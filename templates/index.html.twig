<h1>Initials to 3-letter code stations lookup</h1>

<h2>Enter your initials and I'll tell you if there is a matching station code</h2>

<p>Want to know if your initials are the same as the three letter shortcode for a station? We have the data
here to do it! Type in three letters (i.e your initials) and see if it matches up with a railway station
on the National Rail network ... (<a href="http://www.geofftech.co.uk/download/">original idea and Windows App by Geoff Marshall</a>)</p>

<p>For example, If your name was 'Andrew B. Davidson' then 'ABD' is the code for 'Aberdeen'.</p>

<p>This looks at 2,571 stations with codes, from a list of all National Rail station names and
  their <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/48541.aspx">3 letter alpha codes</a>.</p>

<div id="stationCodeLookup">
  <input id="stationCode" type="text" />
  <span id="stationCodeError"></span>

  <p>
    You have typed: <span id="stationCodeDisplay">(nothing yet)</span>

    <span id="stationCodeResult"></span>

<h2>About Alister Bulman</h2>

<p>I'm a PHP developer, usually with the Symfony Framework. This site is a combination of two things:
  <ul>
    <li>Wanting to try Symfony 4 Flex, using Webpack for Javascript</li>
    <li id="GeoffTech">My second visit to <a href="https://festivalofthespokennerd.com/show/an-evening-of-unnecessary-detail/">An Evening Of Unnecessary Detail</a>
      with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/geofftech2/featured">Geoff Marshall</a> (and Vicki!) who made the
      <a href="http://www.geofftech.co.uk/download/">Station Initials Lookup Tool</a>. That was an app for  Windows,
      and I thought it would be a fun prject to put much the same data online as a simple website.
